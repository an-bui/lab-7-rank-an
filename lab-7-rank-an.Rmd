I am Sam and I am a collaborator! I'm going to make some histograms

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
kermit <- read_csv("kermit.csv")

# Sam made a histogram
kermit_hist <- ggplot(kermit, aes(x = Score.pre)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  facet_wrap(~ Gender)

kermit_hist

# Was there a sig difference in kermit perception for pre-talk and post-talk scores?
```
